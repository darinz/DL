# Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep neural networks trained on massive text corpora to understand and generate human-like language. They are foundational to many modern NLP applications, such as chatbots, translation, summarization, and more.

## 1. What is a Large Language Model?

An LLM is typically a neural network with hundreds of millions to billions of parameters, trained to predict the next word in a sequence given the previous words. The most common architecture for LLMs is the Transformer.

> **Note:** The number of parameters refers to the weights in the neural network. More parameters generally mean a more expressive model, but also require more data and compute to train.

## 2. Transformer Architecture

The Transformer is based on self-attention mechanisms, allowing the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence.

```math
\text{Self-Attention:}\quad \mathrm{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \mathrm{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
```

**Explanation:**
- **Self-attention** allows each word (token) in a sequence to attend to (i.e., consider) every other word, including itself, when forming its representation.
- $Q$ (Query), $K$ (Key), and $V$ (Value) are matrices derived from the input embeddings via learned linear projections.
- $QK^T$ computes the similarity between queries and keys (i.e., how much focus each word should have on others).
- Dividing by $\sqrt{d_k}$ (the dimension of the key vectors) stabilizes gradients.
- $\mathrm{softmax}$ normalizes the scores so they sum to 1 (like probabilities).
- The result is multiplied by $V$ to get a weighted sum of values, producing the output for each token.

### Multi-Head Attention

Instead of performing a single attention function, the Transformer uses multiple heads:

```math
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h)W^O
```

where each $\text{head}_i = \mathrm{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)$.

**Explanation:**
- **Multi-head attention** allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.
- Each head has its own set of projection matrices ($W_i^Q, W_i^K, W_i^V$), enabling the model to capture various types of relationships.
- The outputs of all heads are concatenated and projected again ($W^O$) to form the final output.

## 3. Training Objective

LLMs are usually trained with a language modeling objective:

$`P(x) = \prod_{t=1}^T P(x_t \mid x_{<t})`$

where $x$ is a sequence of tokens.

**Explanation:**
- The model learns to predict the probability of each token $x_t$ given all previous tokens $x_{<t}$.
- The product over $t$ means the probability of the whole sequence is the product of the probabilities of each token, conditioned on the previous ones.
- This is called **autoregressive** modeling.

## 4. Example: Using HuggingFace Transformers

Below is a simple example of using a pre-trained GPT-2 model to generate text in Python:

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
import torch

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "gpt2"
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)  # Converts text to tokens
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)    # Loads the GPT-2 model

# Encode input prompt
prompt = "Deep learning is"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")  # Converts prompt to tensor

# Generate text
output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=30, num_return_sequences=1)  # Generates continuation

# Decode and print
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))  # Converts tokens back to text
```

**Code Annotations:**
- `GPT2Tokenizer` and `GPT2LMHeadModel` are classes from HuggingFace's Transformers library for tokenizing text and loading the GPT-2 model, respectively.
- The prompt is encoded into input IDs (token indices) suitable for the model.
- `model.generate` produces a sequence of tokens extending the prompt.
- The output is decoded back into human-readable text.

> **Tip:** You can change `max_length` to control how long the generated text will be.

## 5. Scaling Laws

Research has shown that increasing the size of LLMs (parameters, data, compute) leads to improved performance, following predictable scaling laws.

**Explanation:**
- **Scaling laws** describe how model performance improves as you increase model size, dataset size, or compute power.
- There are diminishing returns, but larger models generally perform better if trained with enough data and compute.
- See [Kaplan et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361) for details.

## 6. Applications
- **Text generation:** Creating new text, stories, or code from prompts.
- **Summarization:** Condensing long documents into shorter summaries.
- **Translation:** Converting text from one language to another.
- **Dialogue systems:** Powering chatbots and conversational agents.
- **Code generation:** Writing code from natural language descriptions.
