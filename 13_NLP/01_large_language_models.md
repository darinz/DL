# Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep neural networks trained on massive text corpora to understand and generate human-like language. They are foundational to many modern NLP applications, such as chatbots, translation, summarization, and more.

## 1. What is a Large Language Model?

An LLM is typically a neural network with hundreds of millions to billions of parameters, trained to predict the next word in a sequence given the previous words. The most common architecture for LLMs is the Transformer.

## 2. Transformer Architecture

The Transformer is based on self-attention mechanisms, allowing the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence.

```math
\text{Self-Attention:}\quad \mathrm{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \mathrm{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
```

Where:
- $`Q`$ = Query matrix
- $`K`$ = Key matrix
- $`V`$ = Value matrix
- $`d_k`$ = Dimension of the key vectors

### Multi-Head Attention

Instead of performing a single attention function, the Transformer uses multiple heads:

```math
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h)W^O
```

where each $`\text{head}_i = \mathrm{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)`$.

## 3. Training Objective

LLMs are usually trained with a language modeling objective:

$`P(x) = \prod_{t=1}^T P(x_t \mid x_{<t})`$

where $`x`$ is a sequence of tokens.

## 4. Example: Using HuggingFace Transformers

Below is a simple example of using a pre-trained GPT-2 model to generate text in Python:

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
import torch

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "gpt2"
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Encode input prompt
prompt = "Deep learning is"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate text
output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=30, num_return_sequences=1)

# Decode and print
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

## 5. Scaling Laws

Research has shown that increasing the size of LLMs (parameters, data, compute) leads to improved performance, following predictable scaling laws.
