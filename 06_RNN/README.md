# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

This section covers the fundamental concepts and advanced techniques in Recurrent Neural Networks, which are specialized for processing sequential data.

## Overview

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks designed to work with sequential data. Unlike feedforward networks, RNNs have connections that form directed cycles, allowing them to maintain internal memory and process sequences of arbitrary length.

## Key Topics

### 1. [Sequential Data Processing](01_sequential_data_processing.md)
- **Variable-length sequences** - Handling inputs of different lengths
- **Temporal dependencies** - Capturing relationships across time steps
- **Sequence modeling** - Understanding patterns in ordered data
- **Memory mechanisms** - Maintaining information across time steps

### 2. [Vanilla RNNs](02_vanilla_rnns.md)
- **Basic recurrent architecture** - Simple feedback connections
- **Hidden state dynamics** - How information flows through time

- **Mathematical formulation**

### 3. [Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)](03_lstm.md)
- **Gated memory cells** - Selective information storage and retrieval
- **Forget gate** - Deciding what to discard from cell state

### 5. [Bidirectional RNNs](05_bidirectional_rnns.md)
- **Forward and backward processing** - Information from both past and future
- **Context awareness** - Understanding current position in sequence

- **Selective focus** - Paying attention to relevant parts of input
- **Alignment scores** - Measuring relevance between positions
- **Context vectors** - Weighted combinations of hidden states
