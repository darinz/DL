# Distributed Training

Distributed training enables training large models across multiple devices, machines, or clusters by distributing computation and data across multiple workers.

> **Explanation:**
> Distributed training means splitting up the work of training a neural network across several GPUs, computers, or even data centers. This allows you to train much larger models and datasets than would fit on a single device, and to finish training much faster.

> **Key Insight:** Distributed training is essential for scaling deep learning to massive datasets and models that cannot fit on a single device.

> **Did you know?** The largest language models (like GPT-3) are trained on thousands of GPUs using advanced distributed training techniques!

## Overview

Distributed training addresses the limitations of single-device training by:
- **Scaling beyond single GPU memory limits**
- **Reducing training time through parallelization**
- **Enabling training of larger models**
- **Improving resource utilization**

> **Geometric Intuition:** Imagine a team of workers building a house. If each worker builds a different part at the same time, the house is finished much faster than if one person did all the work. Distributed training works the same way for neural networks.

## Types of Parallelism

### 1. Data Parallelism
Distributes data across multiple devices, with each device having a complete copy of the model.

> **Explanation:**
> Each GPU gets a different chunk of the data, but all GPUs have the same model. After each batch, gradients are averaged and the model is synchronized.

### 2. Model Parallelism
Splits the model across multiple devices, with each device responsible for different parts of the model.

> **Explanation:**
> The model itself is too big for one device, so it's split into pieces. Each device computes only its part, and data is passed between devices as needed.

### 3. Pipeline Parallelism
Divides the model into stages that are processed sequentially across different devices.

> **Explanation:**
> Like an assembly line: each device handles a stage of the model, and data flows through the pipeline.

> **Common Pitfall:** Communication overhead can become a bottleneck if not managed properly, especially in model and pipeline parallelism.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Data Parallelism

#### Synchronous SGD
```math
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \nabla L_i(\theta_t)
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $`\theta_t`$: Model parameters at step $t$.
> - $`\alpha`$: Learning rate.
> - $`N`$: Number of devices (workers).
> - $`\nabla L_i(\theta_t)`$: Gradient computed on device $i$.
> - All devices compute gradients on their data, then average them to update the model.

#### Asynchronous SGD
```math
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \alpha \cdot \nabla L_i(\theta_t)
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - Each device updates the model independently, which can lead to faster but less stable training.

### Model Parallelism
For a model split across $`K`$ devices:
```math
f(x) = f_K(f_{K-1}(\ldots f_1(x)))
```
> **Explanation:**
> The input is processed by the first part of the model on one device, then passed to the next device, and so on.

### Communication Overhead
```math
T_{\text{comm}} = \frac{\text{Model Size}}{\text{Bandwidth}} + \text{Latency}
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $`T_{\text{comm}}`$: Time spent communicating between devices.
> - $`\text{Model Size}`$: Amount of data to send.
> - $`\text{Bandwidth}`$: How fast data can be sent.
> - $`\text{Latency}`$: Delay before data transfer starts.

> **Key Insight:** The speedup from distributed training depends on both computation and communication costs. Efficient communication is crucial for scaling.

## Implementation Strategies

### 1. PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.distributed as dist
from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP
from torch.utils.data.distributed import DistributedSampler

def setup_distributed():
    """Initialize distributed training."""
    dist.init_process_group(backend='nccl')
    torch.cuda.set_device(dist.get_rank())

def cleanup_distributed():
    """Clean up distributed training."""
    dist.destroy_process_group()

class DistributedTrainer:
    def __init__(self, model, optimizer, world_size, rank):
        self.model = model
        self.optimizer = optimizer
        self.world_size = world_size
        self.rank = rank
        
        # Wrap model with DDP
        self.model = DDP(model, device_ids=[rank])
        
    def train_step(self, data, target):
        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        # Forward pass
        output = self.model(data)
        loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(output, target)
        
        # Backward pass
        loss.backward()
        
        # Optimizer step
        self.optimizer.step()
        
        return loss.item()
```
> **Code Walkthrough:**
> - Initializes distributed training and sets the correct device for each process.
> - Wraps the model in `DistributedDataParallel` to synchronize gradients across devices.
> - Each process computes gradients on its data, then gradients are averaged and the model is updated.

*PyTorch DDP synchronizes gradients across devices after each backward pass, ensuring consistent model updates.*

### 2. Horovod Implementation

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import horovod.torch as hvd

def setup_horovod():
    """Initialize Horovod."""
    hvd.init()
    torch.cuda.set_device(hvd.local_rank())

class HorovodTrainer:
    def __init__(self, model, optimizer):
        self.model = model
        self.optimizer = optimizer
        
        # Scale learning rate by number of workers
        for param_group in self.optimizer.param_groups:
            param_group['lr'] = param_group['lr'] * hvd.size()
        
        # Add Horovod Distributed Optimizer
        self.optimizer = hvd.DistributedOptimizer(
            self.optimizer, named_parameters=model.named_parameters()
        )
        
        # Broadcast parameters from rank 0 to all other processes
        hvd.broadcast_parameters(model.state_dict(), root_rank=0)
        
    def train_step(self, data, target):
        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        # Forward pass
        output = self.model(data)
        loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(output, target)
        
        # Backward pass
        loss.backward()
        
        # Optimizer step
        self.optimizer.step()
        
        return loss.item()
```
> **Code Walkthrough:**
> - Initializes Horovod and sets the device for each process.
> - Scales the learning rate by the number of workers for faster convergence.
> - Uses Horovod's distributed optimizer to synchronize gradients.
> - Broadcasts model parameters from the main process to all others at the start.

*Horovod provides a simple interface for distributed training and can scale to thousands of GPUs.*

### 3. TensorFlow Distribution Strategies

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def create_distributed_model(strategy):
    """Create model with distribution strategy."""
    with strategy.scope():
        model = models.Sequential([
            layers.Dense(512, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
            layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
        ])
        
        model.compile(
            optimizer='adam',
            loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
            metrics=['accuracy']
        )
        
    return model
```
> **Code Walkthrough:**
> - Uses TensorFlow's distribution strategies to run training across multiple devices or machines.
> - The model is created and compiled inside the strategy's scope.
> - Training and evaluation are handled as usual, but distributed across devices.

*TensorFlow's distribution strategies make it easy to scale training across multiple GPUs, machines, or TPUs.*

> **Key Insight:** Distributed training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, enabling breakthroughs in scale and performance.

## Communication Patterns

### 1. AllReduce Operation

```python
import torch
import torch.distributed as dist

def allreduce_example():
    """Example of AllReduce operation."""
    # Create tensor on each process
    tensor = torch.randn(10).cuda()
    
    # AllReduce operation
    dist.all_reduce(tensor, op=dist.ReduceOp.SUM)
    
    # Result is sum of tensors from all processes
    return tensor

def allgather_example():
    """Example of AllGather operation."""
    # Create tensor on each process
    tensor = torch.randn(10).cuda()
    
    # AllGather operation
    gathered_tensors = [torch.zeros_like(tensor) for _ in range(dist.get_world_size())]
    dist.all_gather(gathered_tensors, tensor)
    
    # Result is list of tensors from all processes
    return gathered_tensors

def broadcast_example():
    """Example of Broadcast operation."""
    if dist.get_rank() == 0:
        tensor = torch.randn(10).cuda()
    else:
        tensor = torch.zeros(10).cuda()
    
    # Broadcast from rank 0 to all other processes
    dist.broadcast(tensor, src=0)
    
    return tensor
```
> **Code Walkthrough:**
> - Shows how to use PyTorch's distributed communication primitives.
> - `all_reduce` sums tensors across all processes.
> - `all_gather` collects tensors from all processes into a list.
> - `broadcast` sends a tensor from one process to all others.

### 2. Custom Communication

```python
class CustomCommunication:
    def __init__(self, world_size, rank):
        self.world_size = world_size
        self.rank = rank
        
    def ring_allreduce(self, tensor):
        """Implement ring AllReduce."""
        # Split tensor into chunks
        chunk_size = tensor.numel() // self.world_size
        chunks = tensor.chunk(self.world_size)
        
        # Scatter-reduce phase
        for step in range(self.world_size - 1):
            send_rank = (self.rank + 1) % self.world_size
            recv_rank = (self.rank - 1) % self.world_size
            
            # Send chunk to next rank
            dist.send(chunks[self.rank], dst=send_rank)
            
            # Receive chunk from previous rank
            received_chunk = torch.zeros_like(chunks[self.rank])
            dist.recv(received_chunk, src=recv_rank)
```
> **Code Walkthrough:**
> - Demonstrates a custom ring AllReduce implementation for distributed communication.
> - Each process sends and receives chunks of data in a ring pattern to efficiently sum tensors across all devices.

> **Try it yourself!** Implement your own communication pattern and measure its efficiency compared to built-in operations.

> **Key Insight:** Efficient communication is as important as computation for scaling distributed training.

## Performance Optimization

class GradientCompression:
    def __init__(self, compression_ratio=0.1):
        self.compression_ratio = compression_ratio
        
    def compress_gradients(self, gradients):
        """Compress gradients using top-k sparsification."""
        compressed_gradients = []
        
        for grad in gradients:
            if grad is None:
                compressed_gradients.append(None)
                continue
                
            # Flatten gradient
            flat_grad = grad.view(-1)
            
            # Select top-k elements
            k = int(flat_grad.numel() * self.compression_ratio)
            _, indices = torch.topk(torch.abs(flat_grad), k)
            
            # Create sparse gradient
            compressed_grad = torch.zeros_like(flat_grad)
            compressed_grad[indices] = flat_grad[indices]
            
            compressed_gradients.append(compressed_grad.view_as(grad))
        
        return compressed_gradients
    
    def decompress_gradients(self, compressed_gradients):
        """Decompress gradients."""
        return compressed_gradients  # Already in correct format
```

        self.world_size = world_size
        
    def train_step_overlapped(self, data, target):
        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        # Forward pass
        output = self.model(data)
        loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(output, target)
        
        # Backward pass
        loss.backward()
        
        # Start communication asynchronously
        handles = []
        for param in self.model.parameters():
            if param.grad is not None:
                handle = dist.all_reduce(param.grad, op=dist.ReduceOp.SUM, async_op=True)
                handles.append(handle)
        
        # Wait for communication to complete
        for handle in handles:
            handle.wait()
        
        # Scale gradients
        for param in self.model.parameters():
            if param.grad is not None:
                param.grad.data /= self.world_size
        
        # Optimizer step
        self.optimizer.step()
        
        return loss.item()
```

import torch.distributed as dist

class PerformanceMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.timings = {}
        
    def start_timer(self, name):
        """Start timing an operation."""

        return 0
    
    def monitor_training(self, trainer, data_loader, num_steps=100):
        """Monitor training performance."""
        self.start_timer("total_training")
        
        for i, (data, target) in enumerate(data_loader):
            if i >= num_steps:

                print(f"Step {i}, Loss: {loss:.4f}")
        
        self.end_timer("total_training")
```

### 2. Communication Profiling

def profile_communication():
    """Profile communication overhead."""
    import torch.distributed as dist
    
    # Test different tensor sizes
    sizes = [1024, 10240, 102400, 1024000]
    
    for size in sizes:
        tensor = torch.randn(size).cuda()
        
        # Time AllReduce
        start_time = time.time()
        dist.all_reduce(tensor, op=dist.ReduceOp.SUM)
        torch.cuda.synchronize()
        end_time = time.time()
        
        duration = end_time - start_time
        bandwidth = (size * 4 * 2) / (duration * 1024 * 1024)  # MB/s
        
        print(f"Size: {size}, Time: {duration:.4f}s, Bandwidth: {bandwidth:.2f} MB/s")

## Summary

Distributed training is essential for scaling deep learning to large models and datasets. Key considerations:

1. **Choose appropriate parallelism strategy** based on model and data characteristics
2. **Optimize communication** to minimize overhead
3. **Monitor performance** to identify bottlenecks
4. **Implement fault tolerance** for production systems
5. **Use established frameworks** like PyTorch DDP or Horovod

Proper implementation can achieve near-linear scaling and significantly reduce training time.
