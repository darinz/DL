## What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. Inspired by the human brain's neural structure, these networks can automatically learn hierarchical representations from raw input data, enabling breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and many other domains.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Hierarchical Learning**: Automatically discovers features at multiple levels of abstraction
- **End-to-End Learning**: Learns directly from raw data without manual feature engineering
- **Scalability**: Performance improves with more data and computational resources
- **Versatility**: Applicable across diverse domains and data types

**Applications:**
- **Computer Vision**: Image classification, object detection, medical imaging
- **Natural Language Processing**: Machine translation, text generation, sentiment analysis
- **Speech Recognition**: Voice assistants, transcription services
- **Autonomous Systems**: Self-driving cars, robotics, game playing
- **Healthcare**: Drug discovery, disease diagnosis, medical image analysis
- **Finance**: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, risk assessment
