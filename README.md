## What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. Inspired by the human brain's neural structure, these networks can automatically learn hierarchical representations from raw input data, enabling breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and many other domains.
