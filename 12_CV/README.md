## Fundamental Concepts

### Image Representation
- **Digital Images:** 2D arrays of pixels with intensity values. Each pixel can be represented as a vector in a color space (e.g., $`[R, G, B]`$).
- **Color Spaces:** $`\text{RGB}`$, $`\text{HSV}`$, $`\text{LAB}`$, $`\text{YUV}`$ — each offers unique advantages for different tasks.
- **Image Formats:** JPEG, PNG, TIFF, RAW — trade-offs between compression, quality, and metadata.

> **Did you know?** The human eye is more sensitive to green light, which is why the green channel is often weighted more in image processing.

### Mathematical Foundations
- **Convolution Operations:** Core building block for feature extraction. See the math section below for detailed formulas.
- **Fourier Transform:** Analyzes images in the frequency domain, revealing patterns not visible in the spatial domain.
- **Geometric Transformations:** Rotation, scaling, translation — essential for data augmentation and invariance.

## Image Processing Basics

### Filtering and Enhancement
- **Gaussian Blur:** Reduces noise and smooths images by convolving with a Gaussian kernel.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Convolution Operations
$`(f * g)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau) g(t - \tau) d\tau`$

For discrete 2D convolution:
$`(I * K)(i,j) = \sum_{m} \sum_{n} I(m,n) K(i-m, j-n)`$

### Backpropagation in CNNs
$`\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{i,j}^{(l)}} = \sum_{m} \sum_{n} \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_{m,n}^{(l+1)}} \frac{\partial y_{m,n}^{(l+1)}}{\partial x_{i,j}^{(l)}}`$

### Loss Functions

**Cross-Entropy Loss**:
$`L = -\sum_{i} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)`$

**Focal Loss** (for object detection):
$`L = -\alpha_t (1 - p_t)^\gamma \log(p_t)`$

**Dice Loss** (for segmentation):
$`L = 1 - \frac{2 \sum_{i} y_i \hat{y}_i}{\sum_{i} y_i + \sum_{i} \hat{y}_i}`$

> **Key Insight:** The choice of loss function can dramatically affect model performance, especially in imbalanced datasets.
