# Feature Detection and Description

> **Key Insight:** Feature detection and description are foundational for many computer vision tasks, enabling algorithms to identify, match, and track distinctive patterns in images.

## 1. Traditional Feature Detectors

### Harris Corner Detector

The Harris corner detector identifies corners by analyzing the local autocorrelation matrix, which captures how the image intensity changes in a small window. Corners are points where the image gradient has significant changes in both directions.

**Autocorrelation Matrix:**
```math
M = \begin{bmatrix} \sum I_x^2 & \sum I_x I_y \\ \sum I_x I_y & \sum I_y^2 \end{bmatrix}
```
- $`I_x, I_y`$ are the image gradients in the $`x`$ and $`y`$ directions, respectively.

**Corner Response Function:**
```math
R = \det(M) - k \cdot \text{trace}(M)^2 = \lambda_1 \lambda_2 - k(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2)^2
```
- $`\lambda_1, \lambda_2`$ are the eigenvalues of $`M`$.
- $`k`$ is a sensitivity parameter (typically $`0.04 \text{ to } 0.06`$).

**Corner Classification:**
- $`R > 0`$ and large: Corner
- $`R < 0`$: Edge
- $`R \approx 0`$: Flat region

> **Geometric Intuition:**
> Imagine sliding a small window over the image. If the window covers a corner, shifting it in any direction causes a large change in intensity. If it covers an edge, only shifts perpendicular to the edge cause large changes. In flat regions, shifts cause little change.

> **Try it yourself!**
> Visualize the Harris response map $`R`$ for a simple image with corners and edges. Where are the highest values?

### SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)

SIFT detects and describes features that are invariant to scale, rotation, and illumination changes. It is widely used for robust matching across images.

#### Scale Space Construction
**Gaussian Scale Space:**
```math
L(x, y, \sigma) = G(x, y, \sigma) * I(x, y)
```
- $`G(x, y, \sigma)`$ is a Gaussian kernel with standard deviation $`\sigma`$.
- $`*`$ denotes convolution.

**Difference of Gaussians (DoG):**
```math
D(x, y, \sigma) = L(x, y, k\sigma) - L(x, y, \sigma)
```
- $`k`$ is a constant multiplicative factor between scales.

#### Keypoint Detection
1. **Extrema Detection:** Find local maxima/minima in the DoG pyramid.
2. **Keypoint Localization:** Refine keypoint location using a Taylor expansion.
3. **Orientation Assignment:** Compute dominant gradient orientation for rotation invariance.

**Gradient Magnitude and Orientation:**
$`m(x, y) = \sqrt{L_x^2 + L_y^2}`$
$`\theta(x, y) = \arctan\left(\frac{L_y}{L_x}\right)`$

#### SIFT Descriptor
- 4×4 spatial bins
- 8 orientation bins per spatial bin
- Total: $`4 \times 4 \times 8 = 128`$ dimensions

**Descriptor Computation:**
```math
d_i = \sum_{(x,y) \in \text{bin}_i} m(x, y) \cdot w(x, y) \cdot \delta(\theta(x, y))
```
- $`w(x, y)`$ is a Gaussian weight.
- $`\delta(\theta)`$ assigns the gradient to an orientation bin.

> **Did you know?**
> SIFT was patented until 2020, which is why some open-source libraries used alternatives like ORB and SURF.

---

### SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features)

SURF is a faster alternative to SIFT, using integral images and box filters for speed.

**Integral Image:**
```math
I_{\Sigma}(x, y) = \sum_{i=0}^{x} \sum_{j=0}^{y} I(i, j)
```

**Box Filter Response:**
$`D_{xx} = \sum_{i \in \text{box}} I(i) - 2 \sum_{i \in \text{center}} I(i) + \sum_{i \in \text{box}} I(i)`$

- Integral images allow for fast computation of box sums, regardless of size.

#### SURF Descriptor
- 4×4 sub-regions
- 4 responses per sub-region (dx, dy, |dx|, |dy|)
- Total: $`4 \times 4 \times 4 = 64`$ dimensions

> **Common Pitfall:**
> SURF is not truly scale-invariant for very large changes in scale. Always check the scale range of your images.

---

### ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)

ORB combines FAST corner detection with rotated BRIEF descriptors for speed and efficiency.

#### FAST Corner Detection
**Corner Response:**
```math
\text{FAST}(p) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \sum_{i=1}^{16} |I(p_i) - I(p)| > \tau \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
```
- $`p_i`$ are the 16 pixels in a circle around $`p`$.

#### BRIEF Descriptor
**Binary descriptor:**
```math
\tau(p; x, y) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } I(p + x) < I(p + y) \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
```

**ORB Descriptor:**
$`\text{ORB}(p) = \{\tau(p; x_i, y_i) : i = 1, 2, ..., 256\}`$

> **Key Insight:**
> ORB is extremely fast and suitable for real-time applications, but may be less robust to large viewpoint or illumination changes compared to SIFT.

## 2. Feature Descriptors

### HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)

HOG computes histograms of gradient orientations in local cells, capturing edge and texture information.

**Gradient Computation:**
$`G_x = I(x+1, y) - I(x-1, y)`$
$`G_y = I(x, y+1) - I(x, y-1)`$

**Gradient Magnitude and Orientation:**
$`m(x, y) = \sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2}`$
$`\theta(x, y) = \arctan\left(\frac{G_y}{G_x}\right)`$

**HOG Descriptor:**
```math
h_i = \sum_{(x,y) \in \text{cell}_i} m(x, y) \cdot \delta(\theta(x, y))
```

> **Try it yourself!**
> Compute the HOG descriptor for a simple image and visualize the histogram. Which orientations are most common?

### LBP (Local Binary Pattern)

LBP encodes local texture information using binary patterns.

**LBP Operator:**
```math
\text{LBP}(x_c, y_c) = \sum_{i=0}^{7} 2^i \cdot s(I_i - I_c)
```
Where
$`s(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ 0 & \text{if } x < 0 \end{cases}`$

**Uniform LBP:**
```math
\text{LBP}_{u2}(x_c, y_c) = \begin{cases}
\sum_{i=0}^{7} s(I_i - I_c) & \text{if } U(\text{LBP}) \leq 2 \\
9 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
```
- $`U(\text{LBP})`$ is the number of bit transitions.

> **Did you know?**
> LBP is highly efficient and works well for texture classification, but is sensitive to noise.

## 3. Deep Learning Features

### CNN Feature Extraction

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can extract powerful features from images, often outperforming hand-crafted features.

**Convolutional Layer:**
```math
F_{i,j,k} = \sum_{m} \sum_{n} \sum_{c} I_{i+m, j+n, c} \cdot W_{m,n,c,k} + b_k
```
- $`I_{i+m, j+n, c}`$: Input image pixel at location $`(i+m, j+n)`$ and channel $`c`$
- $`W_{m,n,c,k}`$: Weight of the filter
- $`b_k`$: Bias term

**Pooling Layer:**
$`P_{i,j,k} = \max_{(m,n) \in R_{i,j}} F_{m,n,k}`$

### Transfer Learning for Features

**Feature Extraction:**
$`\phi(x) = f_{L-1}(f_{L-2}(...f_1(x)))`$
- $`f_i`$ are the layers of a pre-trained network.

> **Key Insight:**
> Features from deep networks trained on large datasets (like ImageNet) can be reused for many tasks, even with limited new data.

## 4. Feature Matching

### Brute Force Matching

**Distance Metrics:**
- **Euclidean Distance:** $`d(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i} (x_i - y_i)^2}`$
- **Manhattan Distance:** $`d(x, y) = \sum_{i} |x_i - y_i|`$
- **Cosine Distance:** $`d(x, y) = 1 - \frac{x \cdot y}{\|x\| \|y\|}`$

> **Common Pitfall:**
> Brute force matching is slow for large datasets. Use approximate methods like FLANN for scalability.

### FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors)

**KD-Tree Search:**
$`\text{Search}(q, T) = \arg\min_{p \in T} \|q - p\|`$

**LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing):**
$`h_i(x) = \left\lfloor \frac{a_i \cdot x + b_i}{w} \right\rfloor`$
- $`a_i`$ is a random vector, $`b_i`$ is a random offset.

### RANSAC for Outlier Rejection

**RANSAC Algorithm:**
1. Randomly sample minimal subset
2. Fit model to subset
3. Count inliers
4. Repeat and keep best model

**Inlier Criterion:**
$`\text{inlier} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } d(x, \text{model}) < \tau \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}`$

> **Try it yourself!**
> Implement RANSAC for line fitting in 2D. How does it handle outliers?
