# Semantic Segmentation

> **Key Insight:** Semantic segmentation is the foundation for pixel-level scene understanding, enabling applications like autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics.

## 1. Overview

Semantic segmentation assigns a class label to each pixel in an image, providing dense pixel-level understanding of the scene. Unlike image classification (one label per image) or object detection (bounding boxes), semantic segmentation provides a fine-grained map of what is where in the image.

> **Explanation:**
> Semantic segmentation is like coloring a picture where each color represents a different object class. Instead of just saying "there's a car in this image," semantic segmentation tells you exactly which pixels belong to the car, which belong to the road, which belong to buildings, etc. This pixel-perfect understanding is crucial for applications where you need to know not just what objects are present, but exactly where they are and what shape they have.

$`\text{Semantic Segmentation:}`$
```math
S: \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times C} \rightarrow \{1, 2, ..., K\}^{H \times W}
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $S$: Segmentation function (the neural network).
> - $\mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times C}$: Input space (images with height $H$, width $W$, and $C$ channels).
> - $\{1, 2, ..., K\}^{H \times W}$: Output space (class labels for each pixel).
> - Each pixel $(i, j)$ gets assigned a class label from 1 to $K$.
> - The output has the same spatial dimensions as the input image.
> - This creates a dense pixel-wise classification.

Where $`K`$ is the number of classes, $`H`$ and $`W`$ are the image height and width, and $`C`$ is the number of channels (e.g., 3 for RGB).

> **Did you know?** Semantic segmentation does not distinguish between different instances of the same class (see: instance segmentation).

## 2. Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN)

### Architecture

FCNs replace fully connected layers with convolutional layers, allowing input images of arbitrary size and producing output maps of the same spatial dimensions.

> **Explanation:**
> Traditional CNNs end with fully connected layers that require fixed input sizes and lose spatial information. FCNs solve this by using only convolutional layers, which can handle variable input sizes and preserve spatial relationships. This makes them perfect for segmentation tasks where you need pixel-level predictions.

$`\text{Encoder-Decoder Structure:}`$
```math
F = \text{Encoder}(I) \in \mathbb{R}^{H/32 \times W/32 \times C}
S = \text{Decoder}(F) \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times K}
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $I$: Input image of size $H \times W \times C$.
> - $\text{Encoder}(I)$: Feature extraction (e.g., VGG, ResNet).
> - $F$: Encoded features at reduced resolution ($H/32 \times W/32$).
> - $\text{Decoder}(F)$: Upsampling to restore original resolution.
> - $S$: Final segmentation map with $K$ channels (one per class).
> - The encoder reduces spatial dimensions while increasing semantic information.

- **Encoder:** Extracts hierarchical features, reducing spatial resolution.
- **Decoder:** Upsamples features to original resolution, producing per-pixel class scores.

### Skip Connections

Skip connections help recover spatial details lost during downsampling by fusing features from earlier layers.

> **Explanation:**
> As the encoder processes the image, it loses fine spatial details (like object boundaries) while gaining semantic understanding. Skip connections provide a shortcut for this detailed information to flow directly to the decoder, helping to produce more precise segmentation boundaries.

$`\text{Feature Fusion:}`$
```math
F_{out} = \text{Conv}(F_{high}) + \text{Upsample}(F_{low})
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $F_{high}$: High-level features (semantic, low resolution).
> - $F_{low}$: Low-level features (detailed, high resolution).
> - $\text{Upsample}(F_{low})$: Resizes low-level features to match high-level resolution.
> - $\text{Conv}(F_{high})$: Processes high-level features.
> - $F_{out}$: Combined features with both semantic and spatial information.
> - This fusion creates features that are both semantically rich and spatially precise.

> **Common Pitfall:** Without skip connections, segmentation maps may be overly coarse and miss fine details.

---

## 3. U-Net Architecture

U-Net is a popular encoder-decoder architecture with symmetric skip connections, originally designed for biomedical image segmentation.

> **Explanation:**
> U-Net gets its name from its U-shaped architecture. It has a contracting path (encoder) that captures context, and an expansive path (decoder) that enables precise localization. The skip connections between corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder help preserve fine details that would otherwise be lost during downsampling.

### Encoder Path (Contracting)
$`\text{Downsampling:}`$
```math
F_{i+1} = \text{Down}(F_i) = \text{MaxPool}(\text{ConvBlock}(F_i))
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $F_i$: Features at level $i$.
> - $\text{ConvBlock}(F_i)$: Two 3×3 convolutions with ReLU activation.
> - $\text{MaxPool}$: 2×2 max pooling reduces spatial dimensions by half.
> - $F_{i+1}$: Features at the next level (half the spatial size).
> - This creates a hierarchical feature pyramid.
> - Each level captures features at different scales.

### Decoder Path (Expanding)
$`\text{Upsampling:}`$
```math
F_{i-1} = \text{Up}(F_i) = \text{ConvBlock}(\text{Concat}(\text{Upsample}(F_i), F_{skip}))
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $\text{Upsample}(F_i)$: Transposed convolution or interpolation to double spatial size.
> - $F_{skip}$: Skip connection from corresponding encoder level.
> - $\text{Concat}$: Concatenates upsampled and skip features.
> - $\text{ConvBlock}$: Processes the concatenated features.
> - $F_{i-1}$: Features at the previous level (double the spatial size).
> - This gradually restores spatial resolution while incorporating fine details.

### Skip Connections
$`\text{Concatenation:}`$
```math
F_{concat} = [F_{encoder}, F_{decoder}]
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $F_{encoder}$: Features from encoder path.
> - $F_{decoder}$: Features from decoder path.
> - $[F_{encoder}, F_{decoder}]$: Channel-wise concatenation.
> - This combines low-level spatial details with high-level semantic information.
> - The concatenation preserves all information from both paths.
> - This is crucial for precise boundary localization.

> **Key Insight:** U-Net's skip connections allow precise localization by combining low-level spatial and high-level semantic information.

## 4. DeepLab Family

DeepLab models introduce atrous (dilated) convolutions and spatial pyramid pooling for multi-scale context aggregation.

> **Explanation:**
> DeepLab addresses the challenge of capturing multi-scale context in segmentation. Atrous convolutions allow the network to see a larger area without increasing parameters, while spatial pyramid pooling captures context at multiple scales simultaneously. This is especially important for objects that appear at different sizes in the image.

### DeepLab v1: Atrous Convolution
$`\text{Atrous convolution allows larger receptive fields without increasing parameters.}`$
```math
y[i] = \sum_{k} x[i + r \cdot k] \cdot w[k]
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $x[i]$: Input at position $i$.
> - $w[k]$: Convolution kernel weight at position $k$.
> - $r$: Dilation rate (spacing between kernel elements).
> - $y[i]$: Output at position $i$.
> - When $r = 1$, this is standard convolution.
> - When $r > 1$, kernel elements are spaced apart, increasing receptive field.
> - This captures long-range dependencies without parameter increase.

Where $`r`$ is the dilation rate.

### DeepLab v2: Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP)
$`\text{Multi-scale feature extraction:}`$
```math
F_{ASPP} = \text{Concat}(F_{rate=6}, F_{rate=12}, F_{rate=18}, F_{rate=24})
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $F_{rate=r}$: Features from atrous convolution with rate $r$.
> - Different rates capture context at different scales.
> - Rate 6: Small receptive field (local context).
> - Rate 24: Large receptive field (global context).
> - $\text{Concat}$: Combines multi-scale features.
> - $F_{ASPP}$: Multi-scale feature representation.
> - This enables the network to handle objects of various sizes.

### DeepLab v3+: Encoder-Decoder with ASPP
```math
F_{encoder} = \text{ASPP}(\text{ResNet}(I))
F_{decoder} = \text{Decoder}(F_{encoder}, F_{low})
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $\text{ResNet}(I)$: Backbone network for feature extraction.
> - $\text{ASPP}$: Multi-scale context aggregation.
> - $F_{encoder}$: Encoded features with multi-scale context.
> - $F_{low}$: Low-level features from early layers.
> - $\text{Decoder}$: Refines features and restores spatial resolution.
> - $F_{decoder}$: Final segmentation features.
> - This combines the best of both encoder-decoder and ASPP approaches.

> **Try it yourself!** Experiment with different dilation rates in atrous convolutions to see their effect on segmentation quality.

## 5. Loss Functions

### Cross-Entropy Loss
$`\text{Standard for multi-class segmentation:}`$
```math
L_{CE} = -\sum_{i=1}^{H \times W} \sum_{c=1}^{K} y_{i,c} \log(\hat{y}_{i,c})
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $y_{i,c}$: Ground truth label for pixel $i$ and class $c$ (0 or 1).
> - $\hat{y}_{i,c}$: Predicted probability for pixel $i$ and class $c$.
> - The outer sum is over all pixels in the image.
> - The inner sum is over all classes.
> - This penalizes incorrect class predictions for each pixel.
> - Standard choice for multi-class segmentation.

### Dice Loss
$`\text{Balances class imbalance, especially in medical images:}`$
```math
L_{Dice} = 1 - \frac{2 \sum_{i} y_i \hat{y}_i}{\sum_{i} y_i + \sum_{i} \hat{y}_i}
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $y_i$: Ground truth binary mask for class of interest.
> - $\hat{y}_i$: Predicted probability for class of interest.
> - $\sum_{i} y_i \hat{y}_i$: Intersection between prediction and ground truth.
> - $\sum_{i} y_i + \sum_{i} \hat{y}_i$: Sum of prediction and ground truth areas.
> - Dice coefficient measures overlap (higher is better).
> - Loss is 1 minus Dice coefficient (lower is better).
> - Particularly effective for imbalanced classes.

### Focal Loss
$`\text{Focuses on hard-to-classify pixels:}`$
```math
L_{Focal} = -\sum_{i} (1 - \hat{y}_i)^\gamma y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $(1 - \hat{y}_i)^\gamma$: Focusing parameter that downweights easy examples.
> - $\gamma$: Focusing parameter (typically 2).
> - When $\hat{y}_i$ is close to 1 (easy example), $(1 - \hat{y}_i)^\gamma$ is small.
> - When $\hat{y}_i$ is close to 0 (hard example), $(1 - \hat{y}_i)^\gamma$ is large.
> - This forces the network to focus on difficult pixels.
> - Helps with class imbalance and hard example mining.

> **Common Pitfall:** Using only cross-entropy loss can lead to poor performance on imbalanced datasets. Consider combining with Dice or Focal loss.

---

## 6. Evaluation Metrics

### IoU (Intersection over Union)
$`\text{Measures overlap between prediction and ground truth:}`$
```math
\text{IoU} = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $A$: Predicted segmentation mask.
> - $B$: Ground truth segmentation mask.
> - $|A \cap B|$: Number of pixels in intersection.
> - $|A \cup B|$: Number of pixels in union.
> - IoU ranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (perfect overlap).
> - Also called Jaccard Index.
> - Standard metric for segmentation evaluation.

### mIoU (mean IoU)
$`\text{Average IoU across all classes:}`$
```math
\text{mIoU} = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{c=1}^{K} \text{IoU}_c
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $\text{IoU}_c$: IoU for class $c$.
> - $K$: Number of classes.
> - mIoU averages IoU across all classes.
> - This gives equal weight to all classes regardless of frequency.
> - Standard metric for multi-class segmentation.
> - More robust than pixel accuracy for imbalanced datasets.

### Pixel Accuracy
$`\text{Fraction of correctly classified pixels:}`$
```math
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\sum_{i} \mathbb{1}[y_i = \hat{y}_i]}{H \times W}
```
> **Math Breakdown:**
> - $y_i$: Ground truth label for pixel $i$.
> - $\hat{y}_i$: Predicted label for pixel $i$.
> - $\mathbb{1}[y_i = \hat{y}_i]$: Indicator function (1 if correct, 0 if wrong).
> - $H \times W$: Total number of pixels.
> - This measures the fraction of correctly classified pixels.
> - Can be misleading for imbalanced datasets.

> **Did you know?** mIoU is the standard metric for segmentation challenges like PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes.

                radius = np.random.randint(10, 30)
                y, x = np.ogrid[:image_size[0], :image_size[1]]
                circle_mask = (x - center[0])**2 + (y - center[1])**2 <= radius**2
                mask[circle_mask] = class_id
            elif shape_type == 'rectangle':
                x1, y1 = np.random.randint(10, image_size[0]-40), np.random.randint(10, image_size[1]-40)
                x2, y2 = x1 + np.random.randint(20, 40), y1 + np.random.randint(20, 40)
                mask[y1:y2, x1:x2] = class_id
        images.append(image)
        masks.append(mask)
    return np.array(images), np.array(masks)
```
> **Code Walkthrough:**
> - Creates synthetic images with random geometric shapes.
> - Each shape is assigned a random class ID.
> - Supports circles, rectangles, and triangles.
> - This provides a controlled environment for testing segmentation algorithms.
> - Useful for debugging and understanding model behavior.
